Assignment: User
Objectives:
Practice creating a class and making instances from it
Practice accessing the methods and attributes of different instances
If you've been following along, you're going to utilize the User class we've been discussing for this assignment.

For this assignment, we'll add some functionality to the User class:
class User:		# here's what we have so far
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.account_balance = 0
    # adding the deposit method
    def make_deposit(self, amount):	# takes an argument that is the amount of the deposit
    self.account_balance += amount	# the specific user's account increases by the amount of the value received




make_withdrawal(self, amount) - have this method decrease the user's balance by the amount specified
display_user_balance(self) - have this method print the user's name and account balance to the terminal
eg. "User: Guido van Rossum, Balance: $150
BONUS: transfer_money(self, other_user, amount) - have this method decrease the user's balance by the amount and add that amount to other other_user's balance
