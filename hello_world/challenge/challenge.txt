Assignment: Hello World
Objectives
Practice the different ways to concatenate and print strings
Practice running a Python file
It's time to start creating Python files! As a rite of passage, our first program needs to be Hello World :). Letâ€™s practice string concatenation. Copy the code below, replacing each of the your code here placeholders with the appropriate values. Hopefully it's not too patronizing that every other task below is running the file--this is just a friendly reminder to get into the habit of testing your code regularly!

# 1. TASK: print "Hello World"
print( your code here )
# 2. print "Hello Noelle!" with the name in a variable
name = "Noelle"
print( your code here )	# with a comma
print( your code here )	# with a +
# 3. print "Hello 42!" with the number in a variable
name = 42
print( your code here )	# with a comma
print( your code here )	# with a +	-- this one should give us an error!
# 4. print "I love to eat sushi and pizza." with the foods in variables
fave_food1 = "sushi"
fave_food2 = "pizza"
print( your code here ) # with .format()
print( your code here ) # with an f string
