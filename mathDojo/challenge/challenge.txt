Assignment: MathDojo
Objectives:
Practice creating a class and creating new instances
Practice chaining methods
Practice writing flexible functions that can take a varying number of arguments
Create a Python class called MathDojo that has one attribute, result, and 2 methods: add and subtract. The 2 methods each must take at least 1 parameter, but could take many more.

class MathDojo:
    def __init__(self):
    	self.result = 0
    def add(self, num, *nums):
    	# your code here
    def subtract(self, num, *nums):
    	# your code here
# create an instance:
md = MathDojo()
# to test:
x = md.add(2).add(2,5,1).subtract(3,2).result
print(x)	# should print 5
# run each of the methods a few more times and check the result!

Create a MathDojo class

Write the add method and test it by calling it 3 times, with different numbers of arguments each time

Write the subtract method and test it by calling it 3 times, with different numbers of arguments each time

Make sure you are able to chain methods as demonstrated above
