MathDojo + TDD
Objectives:
Practice using setUp()
Gain familiarity with how to set up tests for our code
Understanding how to use TDD is extremely helpful, especially if you're interested in joining a large company where TDD is used very heavily. Get more practice using TDD by re-doing the MathDojo assignment with TDD. Make sure you use the setUp() method this time to create an instance of the MathDojo before the tests are run.
