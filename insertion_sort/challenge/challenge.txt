Insertion Sort
Objectives:
Execute insertion sort
Build an algorithm for insertion sort. Please watch the video here to understand how insertion sort works and implement the code. Basically, this sort works by starting at index 1, shifting that value to the left until it is sorted relative to all values to the left, and then moving on to the next index position and performing the same shifts until the end of the list is reached. The following animation also shows how insertion sort is done.



Some Tips!
Don't forget to write your plan in a non-programming language first (pseudocode!) and test your base cases before you build your code.

Please refrain from checking other people's code. If your code does NOT work as intended make sure

you are writing up your plan first,
your plan solves your base case, and
your plan solves other base cases you have specified.
Sometimes if you are stuck for too long, you need to just start all over as this can be more efficient to do than dwelling on old code with bugs that are hard to trace.
